  age: "Age can influence perspective based on generational experiences, life stage priorities (e.g., career-building vs. retirement), and cultural touchstones. For example, a younger person might prioritize social change, while an older person might value stability.",
  sex: "Gender identity can shape experiences with social structures, stereotypes, and interpersonal dynamics. A text about workplace dynamics might be read very differently based on one's gender.",
  nationality: "Nationality and cultural background affect social norms, political assumptions, historical context, and language. A discussion about freedom might mean different things to someone from the US versus someone from China.",
  profession: "A person's job influences their daily concerns, expertise, and socioeconomic standing. An article about economic policy will be viewed differently by a teacher versus a hedge fund manager.",
  sexuality: "Sexual orientation can impact experiences of acceptance, discrimination, and community. A story about a family might be interpreted differently based on one's own experiences with societal norms around relationships.",
  religion: "Religious or philosophical beliefs provide a moral framework and shape values. A text discussing ethics or mortality will be filtered through this lens.",
  politicalView: "Political alignment shapes views on governance, social justice, and economic policy. A news report about a protest will be seen differently by someone who is progressive versus someone who is conservative.",
  other: "Unique personal roles or identities (e.g., parent, veteran, artist, activist) can add powerful, specific layers to a person's worldview. A parent might focus on themes of safety and the future for children."
